# ðŸ’¡ Arduino LED Light Sensor Trigger
This project uses an LDR (light-dependent resistor) to read ambient light levels and control three LEDs connected to an Arduino. When the light intensity falls below a certain threshold, the LEDs turn off, simulating an automatic lighting system.

# ðŸ§° Components Used
1 Ã— Arduino UNO

3 Ã— LEDs (any color)

3 Ã— 220Î© Resistors (one per LED)

1 Ã— Light Sensor (LDR)

1 Ã— 10kÎ© Resistor (for voltage divider)

Breadboard & jumper wires

USB cable (for uploading code)

# ðŸ”Œ Circuit Overview
LDR is connected to analog pin A0 using a voltage divider with a 10kÎ© resistor.

LEDs are connected to digital pins:

Pin 11

Pin 12

Pin 13
Each LED has a 220Î© resistor in series to limit current.

GND is shared across the LDR, resistor, and LEDs.

# ðŸ§  Code Functionality
The LDR reads the surrounding light intensity.

The value is mapped inversely to brightness (bright â†’ low number).

If the mapped brightness is greater than 100, all three LEDs turn on.

If it's lower, the LEDs turn off.

The system updates every 50 milliseconds.
